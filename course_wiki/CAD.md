CAD - computer aided design  

The combination of CAD and rapid prototyping allows for the fast design and iteration of mechanical parts. 

We specifically use parametric CAD software - each feature you add to a part references a previous feature. This is both powerful and dangerous: powerful because if you use it right, changes to one part of your design will not affect the rest of the part, dangerous because it is easy to reference the wrong thing and changes will propagate and crash your design.  

I will present how to use [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/), a free program that runs in your browser. It is very similar to SolidWorks (which is available in the mechatronics lab), and NX.  

Watch the following video to see how to do the basics: sketch and extrude.

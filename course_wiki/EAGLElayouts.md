To switch to the board layout view, click the "Generate/switch to board" button, in the to left of the menu bar. Name the .brd file, and EAGLE will open a new window showing an outline of your PCB, with all of the components from the .sch to the left of the board. **Note that you must have both the .sch and .brd open when you are working from now on.** If you close the .sch while working on the .brd, the link between the two files will be lost and changes might not be carried over, creating a large headache.

Use the "Info" button on the outline of your board, and make it 10cm x 10cm. Use the "Grid" button to temporarily set your units to mm to more easily set the size of the board. Set the units back to inches while working, most of our components have 0.1 inch spacing.

Move your parts onto the board, and arrange them, keeping in mind:
* how connectors get plugged in
* optimize the yellow lines so that they don't cross
* in what order parts will be soldered, will soldering in the wrong order make it impossible to solder another part

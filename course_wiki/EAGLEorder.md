Check out this detailed description of the [PCB manufacturing process](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2018/how-is-a-pcb-manufactured).

We will order our PCBs from a company called [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), where 10 copies of a 10cm x 10cm, 2 layer, green, standard spec board cost $5, and take 2-3 days to manufacture (shipping will add another week and about $21). For $39 they can be made in 1 day!  

I'm pretty sure this is the same factory that SeeedStudio uses to make PCBs, for a similar price. 

Both websites require you to upload a .zip file of your gerbers, so when you are done with your design, zip up the gerber files.

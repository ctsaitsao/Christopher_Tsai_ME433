Git is a very powerful tool that lets you backup your work, "branch" your work so that you can make changes without breaking other parts of your code, and "push" changes back into the main branch. Every change you make is given a description, so you will remember what you were thinking when you made the changes. You can compare files to see where they were changed, line by line, and go back to older versions if necessary.

Git is primarily for text-based files, but we will cheat and sometimes upload images and PDFs.

Everything you do for class should be saved into a folder that is backed up on Github and shared with me. You don't have to use all the features of Git, **but part of your grade will be based on how well you document your work and store it on Github.** Every time you make a change to a project, make a new file, or sit down to work, you should make a "commit" to your "repository". **Every time.** Github tracks how often you save your code, so I will know if you are using it correctly. 

A repository is a folder that contains your work. You will name your repository something like "yourName_ME433_2019" or "yourGitName_ME433_2019", and it will eventually be full of folders like HW1, HW2, ..., and other files and folders you find useful.

You may use Github however you like. It is designed to be used from the command line, but there are also desktop apps that are a little easier. I will describe the app provided by Github.

Open the Github desktop app and click the blue "+" in the top left to make a new repository. Give it a name (with your name in it to make it easier for me) and a location for the folder on your computer, and click the "Create repository" button. Note that this will make the folder in the location you selected, and put a file in it (.gitattributes). 

Make a new text file in the folder called README.md. Open README and type in your name, the date, and what one would expect to learn by going through the repository. Save it, and go look at the "Changes" tab of the Github app. Do you see that the README file was made, and you can see the text you added? Save this change to your Github account by adding a summary for that change. Something like: "My first commit!" is the "Hello World!" of Git. You don't have to leave a detailed description unless you did something big or confusing. Then click "Commit to master". This will record your change locally to your computer, but will not upload to Github. To make the change permanent, click the "Publish" button in the top right, and give your repository a description, like "Repo for ME433 projects", and click "Publish name-of-your-repo". Now your repository is live, backed up on Github. 

Go back to your README file and add another line. Save it, go to the Github app, and verify the change. Give the change a summary, commit, and then click "Sync" to upload to Github.

You are now up and running with Github! That is as complicated as it will be for this class. Technically, every time before you start working, you should click "Sync", which will also download any changes that have been made, maybe on a different computer or by a different user, so that you don't change a file that someone else has already changed, but since you are working alone don't worry about it.

Log on to your account at github.com and take a look at your repo. Note that every commit is logged with a timestamp and the summary, and under the pulse tab, the number of commits versus time is recorded. **You should be committing several times every time you sit down to work on a project. I can easily tell how many times you committed to a project, and submitting homeworks with only one commit will mean you lose points!** 

When your repository is ready, go to the Settings tab, and on the left, click on Collaborators, and add ndm736, so that I can more easily find your repository.

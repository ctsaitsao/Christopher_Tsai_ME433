HW10  

Follow the instructions on [CDC](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/CDC) to create a USB CDC Harmony project. Run the sample code before making any changes. In your terminal program, you should see a number incrementing at 5Hz, and if you type anything the characters get echoed back.     

Note that there are comments in the code that point out where you can evaluate data received from the computer and where you can send data to the computer.   

Add your IMU code to the project and initialize the IMU. As an intermediate step, read the IMU and send the data to the computer at 100Hz.  

Then edit the code so that when the PIC receives the letter 'r' from the computer, 100 values of the accelerometer and gyro X, Y, and Z data are output at 100 Hz, in the format "index ax ay az gx gy gz", and then nothing is output until another 'r' is received. Do not echo the 'r' or any other character typed in (that will confuse the program we will write next week).    

Make a video demonstration of your data collection. Upload the video to CANVAS, and place your code in your repo in a folder called HW10.

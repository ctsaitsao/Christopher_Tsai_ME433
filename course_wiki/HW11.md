HW11 

Read up on how to do [DSP](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/DSP) design in MATLAB. Implement the following filters in C on your PIC (try for a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz):  
* a MAF  
* an IIR filter  
* an FIR filter  

Add the filters to your code from HW9. When the PIC receives an 'r' from the computer, send back only the Z axis accelerometer data in the format "index rawValue MAF IIR FIR".  Plot the data any way you like (MATLAB, python, excel, ...). Pick out what you think are the best number of samples and weights for each filter.  

Record a video demonstrating your filters. Show and explain the implementation of each filter, and state which one you think works best, in terms of how much the noise is reduced vs how many computations are required. Submit the video on CANVAS and upload your code to git.

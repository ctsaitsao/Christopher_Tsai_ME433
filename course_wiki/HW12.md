HW12  

Create a project for an HID USB mouse, and test by moving the cursor at a fixed diagonal rate. Add the IMU to your code, and control the cursor by titling your breadboard. Filter the acceleration data if necessary. I suggest sending 0 for the xCoordinate and yCoordinate values 9 out of 10 times, and every 10th cycle send a scaled accelerometer value so that tilting to 30 degrees gets the mouse all the way across the screen in 3 seconds. The exact values you use will vary on every computer you test on, due to the different ways operating systems filter the mouse data.  

Create a video showing how you can control your mouse cursor by tilting your board, and upload to CANVAS. Upload your code to your git repo.

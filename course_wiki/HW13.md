HW13  

You are to design two things: a wheel, and a three-sided box. The wheel will be 3d printed, and the box will be laser cut.  

The wheel must mount to a D-shaped motor shaft, and will use an o-ring as a tire.  

Use a [2" o-ring](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9452k64/=11zqtc7) (plan on using your design again with a [3"](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9452k163/=11zqt75) or [4"](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9452k192/=11zqt23) tire in a future design). Use calipers to measure the motor shaft.  

The box must be made of at least 3 sides, one of which must be a living hinge. Connect the sides with [4-40 screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/#90283a110/=17n5j4p) and [nuts](https://www.mcmaster.com/#90480a005/=17n5inw).  

3d print and laser cut your parts. See me for training on the machines. Upload images of your design and finished parts to your repo.

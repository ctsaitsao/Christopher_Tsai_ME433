HW15

Create some functions to display data on your LCD and update PWM at 100Hz using an interrupt, according to the [Motor Control](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/MotorControl) page.

Upload your code to a folder called HW15 in your repo and a short video demonstrating the LCD plotting capabilities and the LED fading.

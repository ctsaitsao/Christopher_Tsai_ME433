HW16 - Tech Cup Entry  

Read through the instructions for the [Tech Cup](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/TechCup2019)

Solder and test your PCB, including the camera, LCD, and motors. Design a differential drive robot in CAD and laser cut and 3D print the parts. Write code to have your robot follow the line on the Tech Cup 2019 track.

Upload your PIC code to a folder named HW16 in your git repo, and add some images from the CAD design of your robot. Record a video of your robot following the line. Narrate the video, describing the features of your robot, and upload the video to CANVAS.

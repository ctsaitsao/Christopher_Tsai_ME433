We will use a variety of software in ME433:
* [Github](https://desktop.github.com/) - Everything you do should be saved on Github. This makes it easy for you to backup your material, for me to take a look at what you are doing and assign a grade, and for you to share during a job interview (it is quite common to be asked to show your git profile for jobs that require programming). Git can be run from the [command line](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf), but since you are only sharing your code with me, and I won't be contributing, using the desktop app is sufficient. See [this page](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/Github) to see how to setup a project folder to store your assignments.
* We will be using the [PIC32MX250F128B](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC32MX250F128B) in class, and programming with the [MPLAB Snap](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/PartNO/PG164100) programmer, using the MPLABX IDE, XC32 compiler, and the Harmony Integrated Software Framework. Download and install:
    - [MPLABX IDE v5.15](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
    - [MPLABÂ® XC32/32++ Compiler v2.15](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
    - [MPLAB Harmony Integrated Software Framework v2.06](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony)
* You will design a printed circuit board using [EAGLE v9.3.2](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle)

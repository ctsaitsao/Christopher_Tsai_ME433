Design for laser cutting  

3d printing is super slow, and large parts often warp due to uneven cooling. If you can get away with designing your parts with large, flat 2d shapes, then you can use the laser cutter, the ultimate rapid prototyping tool. Laser cutting a part usually only takes minutes.  

A laser cutter burns away material, and ours move only in 2 axes, so all cuts must be perpendicular to the surface. This means you must design your part specifically for manufacturing with the laser cutter, in a process called 2.5d design.  

CAD each component as an extruded sketch the thickness of your material (our "1/8 inch" acrylic is 0.117" thick). Lap joints are not very strong, and difficult to disassemble, so add slots to your design, and t-shaped holes for screws and nuts.  

Laser cut parts will be slightly smaller than your design, losing the "kerf" of the laser thickness. I usually ignore this and try not to design parts that need tolerances closer than 0.01". If you do, try test cutting before committing to your final design (acrylic is very brittle so press fitting is not a very good idea anyway).  

But a cool thing to try is a [living hinge](http://makezine.com/projects/creating-living-hinges/?utm_source=MakeNewsletter+20170418&utm_medium=email&utm_content=button&utm_campaign=newsletter). Cut slots into your design to make a flexible part (use rounded corners, not square as shown in the article).

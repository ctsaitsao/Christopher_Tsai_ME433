## Syllabus for 2019

***Prerequisite: ME333: Introduction to Mechatronics - you will be very lost without this class***

This is an advanced class in mechatronic systems prototyping, open to graduate and undergraduate students. In this course you will learn how to design, solder, and debug a printed circuit board (PCB), learn advanced digital communication protocols like SPI, I2C, and USB, create physical prototypes with a laser cutter and 3d printer, and interface with a camera module. The course will meet twice a week in Ford B100. ***An assignment or demo will likely be due in every class.*** The course will finish with a robot racing competition called the Tech Cup.

ME433 is not an open-ended quarter-long project as it has been in previous years. If you would like to pursue a project, consider an ME399 or ME499 Independent Study (which will be very successful after the skills learned in ME433.)

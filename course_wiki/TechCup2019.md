Your robot must be able to carry the boards described on the [PCB design](https://github.com/ndm736/ME433_2019/wiki/PCBdesign2019) page.

You can start designing your robot and code while we wait for parts. The PCB files are posted, so you can grab dimensions, as well as the following tips:

* The motor, like this, can be mounted from the front plate with M1.6 screws, or you can 3d print or laser cut some kind of bracket.

* Use the 28 gauge stranded wire 

* Use a lock washer with all of your t-slot screws and nuts

* Mount your wheels to the motor shaft with a prop adapter

* Leave room for a 2S ~500mAHr Lipo battery

*
